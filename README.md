# Combat Locked
A [RuneLite](https://runelite.net) plugin to track available combat levels, which get unlocked through the completion of Combat Achievements.
Inspired by [Crukken's](https://www.youtube.com/@Crukken) Youtube series of the same name.

Thanks to the following plugins for their code which was referenced heavily for the implementation of this:
